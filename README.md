# laravel-intervals
This package creates a simple way of adding time intervals to your projects.

## Installing 
```shell
composer require joaorbrandao/laravel-intervals
```
The package will automatically register itself. However if you prefer to register Service Provider by yourself, update your `config/app.php` file:
```php
'providers' => [
    \JoaoBrandao\LaravelIntervals\LaravelIntervalsServiceProvider::class
]
```
A config file is going to be published in "config/laravel-intervals.php".

## Usage
### Configurations
Basically you can make 2 thing you can do: enable/disable the package and create, edit or remove the time intervals.
Each time interval has 5 properties: start, end, enabled, id and name.<br>

| Property | Description                                   |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| start    | Represents the start time of the interval.    |
| end      | Represents the end time of the interval.      |
| enabled  | Enables/disables the usage of the interval.   |
| id       | Identifies the interval as unique.            |
| name     | The interval's name for translation purposes. |


#### 1. Enable/Disable the usage of the package
```php
"enable" => true
```
#### 2. Edit the already existing time intervals
"intervals" is when you will find the already developed time intervals. Go ahead, you can edit as you want!
```php
"intervals" => [
        'last7Days' => [
            'start' => now()->subDays(7),
            'end' => now(),
            'enabled' => true,
            'id' => 'last7Days',
            'name' => 'last_7_days',
        ],
    ],
```

#### 3. Add custom intervals made by yourself
Adding a custom time interval is as easy as adding a new entry set to "intervals" in the configuration file.
```php
"intervals" => [
        'firstDayOfLastWeek' => [
            'start' => now()->subWeek()->startOfWeek()->startOfday(),
            'end' => now()->subWeek()->startOfWeek()->endOfDay(),
            'enabled' => true,
            'id' => 'last7Days',
            'name' => 'last_7_days',
        ],
    ],
```

### Facade
One of the ways of using this is with the Facade.
The result of the facade is the time interval set defined in the configuration file with the start and end properties being Carbon instances.
```php
LaravelIntervals::last7Days();
```
